# SERVERLESS Repo

This repository contains multiple **Serverless Framework** projects that I use for practice and learning.  
Each project has its own functions, endpoints, and documentation.

## Projects in this repo

- [MMDB](./mmdb/README.md)  
  A simple movie database API. Supports adding and retrieving movies with validation using Middy.

- [Top10Books](./top10Books/README.md)  
  A book API that returns a list of top 10 books with details such as title, author, and year.

---

## How to use

Each project can be deployed separately.  
Go into the project folder and follow its README for setup:

```bash
cd mmdb
# or
cd top10Books
